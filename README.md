# Charm Chatroom SSH Thing
A small project using some [charmbracelet](https://github.com/charmbracelet) packages ([bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and [wish](https://github.com/charmbracelet/wish) so far) purely out of curiousity.

## Usage
Build and run the main.go file passing in the ./test.db (or whichever sqlite db file) and then connect over ssh

## TODO
- Make it pretty with Lipgloss etc
- See how it works with multiple concurrent users.
